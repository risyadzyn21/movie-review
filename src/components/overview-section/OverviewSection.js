        {/* <p>The siblings Kashou and Shigure Minazuki enjoy the company of six catgirls.
          Chocola and Vanilla assist Kashou in his job as a baker at the patisserie La Soleil, while the others—Coconut,
          Azuki, Cinnamon, and Maple—accompany Shigure in her daily life back at their home.
          <br />
          <br />
          One afternoon, when Chocola goes out for an errand, she notices a green-haired kitten alone by herself
          at a park and decides to bring her back to the patisserie. Soon after, the Minazuki household adopts her
          and gives her a name: Cacao. With a new member in their family, the members of the Minazuki household continue
          their everyday lives—bound to become livelier than ever.
